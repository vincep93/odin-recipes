        <p>Have you ever looked at your ramen and thought that it could be better! Of course you have! This recipe will show you how to turn that cheap microwave ramen into a delicious dish.</p>
        <p>What you will need:
            <li>A packet or two of ramen</li>
            <li>Green onions</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>peanut or Stir fry oil</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
        </p>
        <p>Get some water boiling and in a frying pan heat up some oil. While we are waiting lets chop up some green onions. Cut them long, about an inch or two. Toss them in the hot oil along with a tablespoon of chopped garlic. Your water should be boiling by now so toss in the ramen and cook it like normal. <strong>Watch out for the oil spitting</strong> this will happen due to the water inside the green onions.</p>
        <p>Once the oil starts to turn the green onions brown we will turn off the heat and using a strainer we will strain the oil into a cup, you can toss out the onion and garlic from the strainer. Set this aside and strain the noodles out of the water. Let them sit for a second to dry out ever so slightly. Toss the noodles into the frying pan and slowly fry them using the oil from the cup. Add soy sauce to the pan to get a nice color and flavor to the noodles. Dont cook to long or the noodles will glue them selves together.</p>
        <p><strong>Look at them things!</strong> You just turned a 50c insta noodle into a classy ramen dish!</p>
