            <p>Yum Yum nothing like some fluffy pancakes for breakfast.</p>
            <p>What you will need:</p>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Bisquick</li>
        
            <p>Sounds easy enough! Heres how it will go together</p>
            <ui>
                <ol>Put 2 cups of Bisquick in a bowl</ol>
                <ol>Put one cup of milk in the bowl</ol>
                <ol>Crack an egg into the bowl</ol>
                <ol>Pour 1/4s cup of oil in the bowl</ol>
            
            
            </ui>
            <p>Now mix it all up until there are no clumps of dried batter. Heat up a skillet and butter her up! Once shes hot use the 1/4 cup that is already dirty to scoop out one pancake worth of mix and pour on the skillet!</p>
            <p><h2>ENJOY</h2></p>
