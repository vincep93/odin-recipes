        <p>Are you tired of buying a $20 bag of Beef Jerky that only has 10 good pieces of meat!? Well cry no more! Here is a great recipe for your own smoked jerky! </p>
        <p>What you will need is:</p>
            <li>A good hunk of Top-Round beef</li>
            <li>1-2 cups of brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of Soy sauce</li>
            <li>A splash of Werstsher sauce</li>
            <li>As much Red pepper flakes as you'd like</li>
            <li>Some onion powder</li>
            <li>A tablespoon of garlic</li>
        <p><h2>Instructions</h2></p>
        <p>Take your meat and slap it down on a cutting board. We are going to shave off slices about 1/8th of an inch. This works best if the meat is cold and you are cutting along the grade. Do this until you have used up all of the meat. Don't worry if you acidentaly slice off a small piece, it will never be perfect. </p>
        <p>You now have all your meat nice and sliced. Take it and throw it all in to a Zip-lock bag. Next we toss in the remaining ingredients. You probrably noticed that there are harldy any specific measurments. <strong>It's ok!</strong> The amount of meat will often change so just eyeball it and over time you will get a feel for what you like. Zip it up and toss it in the fridge for a few days.</p>
        <p>Ok, so you managed to wait two more days but you're going to have to hold on a little longer! Now we have to smoke it! Go to the smoker you never use out back and get it preheating. Once its nice and smokey, take your meat and lay it out on the racks. We want to smoke it for about 4 hours at roughly 160f. If you don't see a temp below 200f but there is a "smoke" option that will run at about 130-160. I like to set a timer for every hour to monitor the heat.</p>
        <p><strong>LOOK AT THAT</strong>, your very own Beef Jerky!</p>
